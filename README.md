# vision_classification
Provide baseline to solve different kinds of vision classification tasks   

<font color=Red>in some days, repo will add kinds of Attentions-Modules, so stay tuned</font>
## introduce
  params setting refer to configs/complete.yaml, include model, data, hyp 
    
  model: support BN freeze, backbone freeze. set out_channels as you like, maybe not equal to num_classes if you want to do training strategy  
  data: support custom-style data augment, all the data augment are placed in utils/augment.py, eg: cutout, colerjitter...  
  hyp: support many loss function eg: ce and bce, support custom-style training stategy, eg: focalloss, mixup and progressive learning  
  training: support ema, progressive learning, focalloss, mixup ... 
    
## usage
  1縲》he repo support "split epochs into augment-epoch and no-augment-epoch, set in XXX.yaml" -> aug_epoch: 25, means augment for 25 epochs then train in no-augment  
  2縲》he repo support "OHEM, set in XXX.yaml" -> bceloss: True, focal: True 30, True means turn on focalloss, 30 means bceloss before 30th epoch and focalloss after. if no focalloss, just set focal: 0 30  
  3縲》he repo support "mixup in given epochs, set in XXX.yaml" -> mixup: 0.2 [20,30], 0.2 means prob to use mixup every epoch, [20,30] means interval to start/delete mixup. if no mixup, just set mixup: 0 [20,30]  
  4縲》he repo support "progressive learning $refer to EfficientV2, set in XXX.yaml" -> prog_learn: True, will effect on image size & mixup, divide into 3 parts in default
